# terrapinavigator - Navigation and Mapping with TurtleBot 

## Overview
This project aims to implement a simulated TurtleBot capable of navigating and mapping. The robotic system aims to be capable of:
1. Navigating Unknown Environments and simultaneously mapping it.
2. Navigating a known environment from point A to point B.
Additionally, the robotic system will have a service be capable of taking photographs at any desired time.
The project will be implemented using Gazebo, Rviz and ROS (and its various packages and libraries.

Few applications of the projects include:
1. Navigation of known environments like offices and factories.
2. Explorer bot to aid rescue efforts during natural disasters.
3. Remote Survaillence 


## About the Developer

I am Pranav Inani. I am currently pursing my masters in Robotics at University of Maryland - College Park. I hold a Bachelors degree in Mechatronics from Mahatma Gandhi Instite of Technology, India. I have worked for a small start-up geared towards solving the self-driving car problem in India (a completely different challenge altogether). I wish to pursue a career in Robotics with a focus in Artificial Intelligence.
Few modest projects I was a part of:
1. Lane Marker Detection Using DBScan Clustering Algorithm.
2. AStar Path Planning Algorithm.
3. Design and Fabrication of Quadcopter with Integrated End-Effector.
4. Home automation Using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
